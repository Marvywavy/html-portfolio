<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Titilayo, and I’m a passionate and driven individual with a background in Mechanical Engineering.
  I earned my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), 
  Ogbomosho, Nigeria, where I developed a strong foundation in both theoretical concepts and hands-on applications. 
  <br>

 I have a natural talent for leadership and teamwork, which I’ve demonstrated through several roles. I served as
  the Hostel Prefect and Head Girl during my time in boarding school, as well as the Vice President of NIMechE 
  (Nigerian Institution of Mechanical Engineers) in my department.
</p>

<p>Professionally, I’ve gained valuable experience through internships. At Elfad Concept, I supervised laborers,
  designed structures using CAD, prepared billing lists, and managed project expenditures. I also completed a project
   related to improving steel corrosion and researched biogas production from human waste. <br>

 I’m passionate about solving real-world problems and contributing to sustainable engineering solutions. In addition 
 to my engineering background, I have a deep love for web development and technology. I’m currently learning HTML and 
 working to expand my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and mobile app development. I’m excited to build a tech career that
  allows me to combine creativity with problem-solving.
 </p>

<p>Beyond academics and work, I have a deep love for music and have dedicated myself to ministry through singing.
  I focus on inspiring others in worship, not just through music but also by reflecting positive values in my lifestyle.
  <br>

 I’m excited about opportunities that allow me to grow, take on challenges, and make meaningful contributions, whether
  in engineering, technology, or administrative roles. I’m always ready to learn and take the next step in my career.
